      At this point, I think we can all agree that bears are just the best. Here
      are some bear thoughts from: https://helloiamabear.com/

    <p class="para" id="second">
      Since I have no way to determine if I am good at being a bear, I really
      have no way to determine if I should have progressed in my bearness. I
      have never gotten any kind of clue or indication that I should be getting
      better at being a bear over some period of time. Should I be a better bear
      each day? Each year? Is my progress meant to be incremental or something
      that should be obvious and very easily noticeable?
