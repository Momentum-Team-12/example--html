        At this point, I think we can all agree that bears are just the best. Here
        are some bear thoughts from: https://helloiamabear.com/

      <p class="para" id="second">
        Since I have no way to determine if I am good at being a bear, I really
        have no way to determine if I should have progressed in my bearness. I
        have never gotten any kind of clue or indication that I should be getting
        better at being a bear over some period of time. Should I be a better bear
        each day? Each year? Is my progress meant to be incremental or something
        that should be obvious and very easily noticeable?
